# api-based-app

Use a 3rd Party API with Authentication

## Required

* API needs a developer account to use a private API key
* Must add `*.xcconfig` to your `.gitconfig` file
* Secrets must be stored ONLY EVER in a `Secrets.xcconfig` file

## Use SwiftLint

Xcode -> File -> Add Package Dependencies -> paste into search `https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins` -> Add Package

Click project file, click your app target, go to Build Phases tab, expand Run Build Tool Plug-ins, click +, add SwiftLint

If you are asked about enabling a macro then you should approve the request

Once you have created your Xcode project, move the SwiftLint file into your project folder, next to your Xcode project file

## Gitignore

I have already added a gitignore file for you, no other configuration should be needed
